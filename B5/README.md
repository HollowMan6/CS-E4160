# B5: VPN
## Motivation
The government is spying on your internet use. Hackers are spying on you. Use VPN to protect yourself. Service providers are blocking overseas customers. Use VPN to bypass this.

You may have heard statements like the ones above from tech news, your favourite streamer or podcaster and VPN advertisements. VPNs can be used as proxies to hide the origin of web traffic by routing traffic through a VPN server in another location. They can also be used to hide your traffic from prying eyes by encrypting the traffic between your computer and the VPN server and burying the traffic into the massive flood of traffic going to and from the VPN server on the other end of the tunnel.

In this assignment, however, you will create a VPN bridge, that allows you to access a LAN network from the outside, as if the computer was a part of that network. You will provide an IP address from said network for the computer. This method can be used for accessing e.g. a corporate network over the internet.

## Description of the exercise
This assignment introduces you to the Virtual Private Network (VPN) concept. You will use OpenVPN and all three VMs to establish a VPN in practice by creating and examining a host-to-net VPN scenario. A roadwarrior host (lab3, RW) establishes a secure tunnel to a gateway (lab1, GW). Traffic can flow from the roadwarrior through the gateway to a Storage server (lab2, SS)  and back. Hosts on the right-side local link can not eavesdrop or modify the traffic flowing inside the tunnel. Hereâ€™s what the resulting network will look like.


The goal of this assignment is to test communication between the Storage Server and the Road Warrior by successfully pinging and tracerouting each other in both directions. OpenVPN will be used in bridging mode to connect the RW to the local network of SS and GW.

How to Create Keys
## 1. Initial Setup
Install openvpn package for GW and RW if it has not been preinstalled. Install also bridge-utils for GW.

On lab1 (GW):

Assign a static IP from the subnet 192.168.0.0/24 to the interface enp0s8
Assign a static IP from the subnet 192.168.2.0/24 to the interface enp0s9
On lab2 (SS):

Assign a static IP from the subnet 192.168.0.0/24 to the interface enp0s8
On lab3 (RW):

Assign a static IP from the subnet 192.168.2.0/24 to the interface enp0s8
In this exercise, the enp0s3 interfaces are only used for SSH remote access. Do not use them for any other traffic. Verify that you can ping the gateway from the other hosts, and that you can not ping the RW from the SSor vice versa. Write down the network configuration.

### 1.1 Present your network configuration. What IPs did you assign to the interfaces (4 interfaces in all) of each of the three hosts?
On lab1 (GW):
- 192.168.0.2 -> enp0s8
- 192.168.2.2 -> enp0s9

On lab2 (SS):
- 192.168.0.3 -> enp0s8

On lab3 (RW):
- 192.168.2.3 -> enp0s8

## 2. Setting up a PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)
The first step in establishing an OpenVPN connection is to build the public key infrastructure (PKI).

You'll need to generate the master Certificate Authority (CA) certificate/key, the server certificate/key and a key for at least one client. In addition you also have to generate the Diffie-Hellman parameters for the server. Note: the Ubuntu openvpn package no longer ships with easy-rsa.

After you have generated all the necessary certificates and keys, copy the necessary files (securely) to the road warrior (RW) host.

### 2.1 What is the purpose of each of the generated files? Which ones are needed by the client?
The purpose of each of the generated files in the PKI for OpenVPN is as follows:

- Master Certificate Authority (CA) certificate/key: This is the root certificate/key that is used to sign all other certificates in the PKI. It is used to establish trust between the OpenVPN server and the clients.
- Server certificate/key: This certificate/key is used by the OpenVPN server to authenticate itself to the clients.
- Client certificate/key: This certificate/key is used by the OpenVPN clients to authenticate themselves to the server.
- Diffie-Hellman (DH) parameters: These parameters are used to establish the initial encryption key that is used for the OpenVPN connection.
- HMac signature: This is used to authenticate the OpenVPN packets and prevent unauthorized access.

For a client to establish a connection with the OpenVPN server, they need to have the following files:
- Client certificate/key
- CA certificate
- The DH parameters
- HMac signature key.

### 2.2 Is there a simpler way of authentication available in OpenVPN? What are its benefits/drawbacks?
Yes, there is a simpler way of authentication available in OpenVPN called "static key authentication". In this method, a pre-shared secret key is used instead of a PKI. Another simpler way is to securely obtain a username and password from a connecting client, and to use that information as a basis for authenticating the client. It is also possible to disable the use of client certificates, and force username/password authentication only. It uses client-cert-not-required may remove the cert and key directives from the client configuration file, but not the ca directive, because it is necessary for the client to verify the server certificate. The benefit of this method is that it is simple to set up and does not require the overhead of a PKI. However, the drawback is that it is less secure than using a PKI, as there is only one shared secret key for all clients and the server. This means that if the key is compromised, all clients are compromised.

## 3. Configuring the VPN server
On GW copy /usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/sample-config-files/server.conf.gz to for example /etc/openvpn and extract it. You have to edit the server.conf to use bridged mode with the correct virtual interface. You also have to check that the keys and certificates point to the correct files. Set the server to listen for connection in GW's enp0s9 IP address.

Start the server on GW with openvpn server.conf .

### 3.1 List and give a short explanation of the commands you used in your server configuration.


### 3.2 What IP address space did you allocate to the OpenVPN clients?

192.168.0.2/24
192.168.0.50-192.168.0.100

### 3.3 Where can you find the log messages of the server by default? How can you change this?
The log messages of the OpenVPN server are typically stored in the syslog on Linux systems. However, the location can be changed by modifying the "status", "log", "log-append" option in the OpenVPN server configuration file. Additionally, the "verb" option can be used to control the verbosity of the log messages.

## 4. Bridging setup
Next you have to setup network bridging on the GW. We'll combine the enp0s8 interface of the gateway with a virtual TAP interface and bridge them together under an umbrella bridge interface.

OpenVPN provides a script for this in /usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/sample-scripts . Copy the bridge-start and the bridge-stop scripts to a different folder for editing. Edit the parameters of the script files to match with GW's enp0s8. Start the bridge and check with ifconfig that the bridging was successful.

### 4.1 Show with ifconfig that you have created the new interfaces (virtual and bridge). What's the IP of the bridge interface?

Same as enp0s8, which is 192.168.0.2

### 4.2 What is the difference between routing and bridging in VPN? What are the benefits/disadvantages of the two? When would you use routing and when bridging?
Routing and bridging are two methods used for forwarding network traffic in a VPN (Virtual Private Network).

Routing:

Routing is the process of forwarding packets of data between different networks based on the network addresses of the packets. In VPN, routing involves using routers to direct traffic between different subnets or networks. When a packet is received, the router checks its destination IP address and then forwards it to the appropriate network.

Benefits:

- Routing is more scalable than bridging as it can handle a larger number of connected devices and networks.
- Routing allows you to implement more advanced network security policies, such as traffic filtering, traffic shaping, and access control.
- Routing provides better performance than bridging, as it reduces network congestion by reducing broadcast traffic.

Disadvantages:

- Routing can be more complicated to set up and manage than bridging, especially if you have a complex network topology.
- Routing requires more configuration on the client-side, and may not be as straightforward as setting up a bridge.

Bridging:

Bridging is the process of forwarding packets of data between two network segments at the data-link layer. In VPN, bridging involves creating a virtual network interface that combines multiple physical interfaces into a single logical interface. All traffic is then forwarded between the virtual interface and the physical interfaces.

Benefits:

- Bridging is simpler to set up and manage than routing, especially for small-scale networks.
- Bridging allows you to connect multiple devices and networks as if they were on the same LAN.
- Bridging is useful for applications that rely on broadcast traffic, such as DHCP, ARP, and some network discovery protocols.

Disadvantages:

- Bridging can lead to broadcast storms and network congestion if the network is too large or has too many connected devices.
- Bridging can be less secure than routing, as it may not support advanced security policies such as traffic filtering, traffic shaping, and access control.

When to use routing vs. bridging in VPN:

Routing is typically used for larger-scale networks where there are multiple subnets and complex network topologies. It is also useful for network architectures that require advanced security policies, such as site-to-site VPNs.

Bridging is typically used for smaller-scale networks with fewer devices, where simplicity and ease of management are more important than advanced security policies. It is also useful for applications that rely on broadcast traffic.

## 5. Configuring the VPN client and testing connection
On RW copy /usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/sample-config-files/client.conf to for example /etc/openvpn. Edit the client.conf to match with the settings of the server. Remember to check that the certificates and keys point to the right folders.

Connect RW to the server on GW with openvpn client.conf. Pinging the SSfrom RW should now work.

If you have problems with the ping not going through, go to VirtualBox network adapter settings and allow promiscuous mode for internal networks that need it.

### 5.1 List and give a short explanation of the commands you used in your VPN client configuration.


### 5.2 Demonstrate that you can reach the SS from the RW. Setup a server on the client with netcat and connect to this with telnet/nc. Send messages to both directions.

```bash
vagrant@lab2:~$ nc -l 5000
vagrant@lab3:~$ nc lab2 5000
```

### 5.3 Capture incoming/outgoing traffic on GW's enp0s9 or RW's enp0s8. Why can't you read the messages sent in 5.2 (in plain text) even if you comment out the cipher command in the config-files?

```bash
vagrant@lab1:~$ sudo tcpdump -i enp0s9
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v[v]... for full protocol decode
listening on enp0s9, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), snapshot length 262144 bytes
15:11:39.271040 IP lab1.openvpn > lab3.38033: UDP, length 103
15:11:39.272148 IP lab3.38033 > lab1.openvpn: UDP, length 90
15:11:43.389403 IP lab1.openvpn > lab3.38033: UDP, length 99
15:11:43.390460 IP lab3.38033 > lab1.openvpn: UDP, length 90
15:11:44.310391 ARP, Request who-has lab3 tell lab1, length 28
15:11:44.310966 ARP, Reply lab3 is-at 08:00:27:87:67:a3 (oui Unknown), length 46
15:11:44.376444 ARP, Request who-has lab1 tell lab3, length 46
15:11:44.376444 IP lab3.38033 > lab1.openvpn: UDP, length 66
15:11:44.376451 ARP, Reply lab1 is-at 08:00:27:0b:9c:95 (oui Unknown), length 28
15:11:44.377095 IP lab1.openvpn > lab3.38033: UDP, length 84
15:11:51.193709 IP lab1.openvpn > lab3.38033: UDP, length 105
15:11:51.194818 IP lab3.38033 > lab1.openvpn: UDP, length 90
15:11:54.587364 IP lab1.openvpn > lab3.38033: UDP, length 96
15:11:54.588168 IP lab3.38033 > lab1.openvpn: UDP, length 90
```

Because after openVPN v2.4 client/server will automatically negotiate AES-256-GCM in TLS mode, the OpenVPN protocol encapsulates the messages inside encrypted packets using SSL/TLS encryption. The messages are only decrypted on the receiving end after going through the OpenVPN encryption and decryption process.

```bash
sudo tcpdump -i enp0s9 -s 0 -w - port 5000
```

### 5.4 Enable ciphering. Is there a way to capture and read the messages sent in 5.2 on GW despite the encryption? Where is the message encrypted and where is it not?

Yes, as enabling ciphering in the OpenVPN configuration will only encrypt the messages being sent between the client and the server using SSL/TLS encryption. The encryption only happens on the client-side after sending the messages and on the server-side before receiving the messages. Therefore, if we capture the packets using a packet capture tool like tcpdump or Wireshark at br0, enp0s8, we are able to read the messages in plain text because they are still encrypted.

Also, as we store certificates on GW (lab1), we have the correct encryption keys or certificates, so we can also decrypt the captured packets and read the messages in plain text. This can be done using Wireshark's SSL/TLS decryption feature. By providing the decryption keys or certificates, Wireshark can decrypt the captured packets and display the contents in plain text.

### 5.5 Traceroute RW from SS and vice versa. Explain the result.

```bash
vagrant@lab3:~$ traceroute lab2
traceroute to lab2 (192.168.0.3), 64 hops max
  1   192.168.0.3  2.035ms  1.307ms  0.856ms
traceroute to lab3 (192.168.2.3), 64 hops max
  1   10.0.2.2  0.448ms  0.346ms  0.328ms 
  2   *  *  * 
  3   * 
```

The result of the traceroute command indicates that the destination host "lab2" with IP address 192.168.0.3 was reached within a single hop, with a response time of 2.035ms. This suggests that the source host and the destination host are on the same local network segment, and there are no intermediate routers or gateways that the packets need to pass through to reach the destination with VPN. Therefore, the packets can be sent directly from the source host to the destination host with minimal latency.

## 6. Setting up routed VPN
In this task, you have to set up routed VPN as opposed to the bridged VPN above.  Stop openvpn service on both server and client.
1. Reconfigure the server.conf and the client.conf to have routed vpn.
2. Restart openvpn service on both server and client.
3. Now you should be able to ping virtual IP address of vpn server from client.
